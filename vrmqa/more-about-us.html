		Why we made VRMQA
		</h2>
	<h4>
		VRMQA was designed and coded by one student for a school project. The reason he picked VRMQA was he was struggling to find good games that where also affordable. Now that VRMQA is here people can share their referal codes along with reveiws for the game so that nobody has trouble finding which game is for them or getting it at a good price.

		  <h2>
		  How it works
		  </h2>
		  
		  <h4>
			VRMQA works by getting referal codes from the Meta Quest app we then write reviews for each game/product. Each game is tried and tested to get accurate reviews and the best possible feedback for the members of VRMQA.
		  </h4>
		  <div class="why">
		  <h2>
			  How you can support us
			  </h2>
			  <h4>
			  
			  VRMQA is purely volenteers, and we often don't get enough store credit from the referals to purchase new games to test for the community. That is why we decided to sell VRMQA branded products to those of you who want to support us and enable us to continue bringing you reviews and referals.
