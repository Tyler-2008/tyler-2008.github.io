	  <h2>Blade and Sorcery<br> Nomad</h2>
	  <h5 class= "p-2">Blade and sorcery nomad is an amazing experience that can often make you run your quest dead. It has a good amount of mod support and just has good game mecahnics overall. Overall Blade and Sorcery Nomad is a fun VR experience that I would recomend to all.</h5>

	  <h2>Meta Quest</h2>
	   
	  <h5 class= "p-2">The Meta Quest is one of the best standalone Virtual reality headsets and can work as a PC VR. It is definately worth having and has a massive catalogue of fun and interesting games with an evergrowing community of people. It even has an app that allows you to purchase and manage all your games. The Meta Quest is great VR headset for people just starting their Virtual Reality journey or people who have already dabbled.</h5>

  <bonelab-review class="col-sm-4" >
	 <h2>Bonelab</h2>
	  <h5 class= "p-2">Bonelab is a fun action packed game with occasionaly (but very rarely) annoying puzzles that make you feel rewarded after you complete them. The guns are realistic with a wide selection of random items that you can hit the enemies with. It can be easily modded and has a very good physics system. there isn't much replayablity when it comes to the story however, the sanbox mode has hours of fun and often silly gameplay. I definitly suggest adding it your your library.</h5>

	<h2>Job Simulator</h2>
	  <h5 class= "p-2">Job Simulator is a great game with lots of fun to be had. It has 4 jobs that have specififc missions that take a while to get through. It also has another mode called "Infinite Overtime" which go's through a series of tasks randomly. I personaly enjoy messing around in the office or convenience store. Job Simulator is a fun game with lot's to do it is a must have</h5>

	<h2>Superhot VR</h2>
	  <h5 class= "p-2">Superhot VR is a fun game with almos matrix-like gameplay. It is really fun and you can try the demo&nbsp;<a style="color:blue;" href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/app/1780841635357133/?utm_source=oculus&utm_medium=share">here.</a> The way it works is the slower you move the slower time moves and you have to fight your way to the end. After completing your first run-through you can replay as much as you want and even play other modes including speedrun, real time, no death and infinite waves. Again this one is definitly one worth having.</h5>
