	  <h2>Meta Quest</h2>
	   
	  <h5 class= "p-2">The Meta Quest is one of the best standalone Virtual reality headsets and can work as a PC VR. It is definately worth having and has a massive catalogue of fun and interesting games with an evergrowing community of people. It even has an app that allows you to purchase and manage all your games.

	 <h2>Bonelab</h2>
	  <h5 class= "p-2">Bonelab is a fun action packed game with occasionaly annoying puzzles that make you feel rewarded after you complete them. The guns are realistic with a wide selection of random items you can hit the enemies with. It can be easily modded and has a very good physics system. there isn't much replayablity when it comes to the story however, the sanbox mode has ours of fun and often silly gameplay. I definitly suggest adding it your your library.</h5>
